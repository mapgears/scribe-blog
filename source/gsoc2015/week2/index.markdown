Hello everyone! This is my second report for the ScribeUI project.

**Completed this week**

* Added a debugging feature to the Scribe project using shp2img.
* Fixed the issue [#117](https://github.com/mapgears/scribeui/issues/117) where the debug window was empty
* Integrated Scribe's new debug into ScribeUI
* Fixed various issues ([#92](https://github.com/mapgears/scribeui/issues/92), [#94](https://github.com/mapgears/scribeui/issues/94), [#118](https://github.com/mapgears/scribeui/issues/118), [#119](https://github.com/mapgears/scribeui/issues/119))

**Plan for next week**

* Using the new debug output, find the location of the errors in ScribeUI
* Highlight them in the code editor

It might be tricky before I can catch all different errors sent by mapserver but I want to get a big part of them next week.

**Blocking issues**

There were no blocking issues this week.

Have a nice week-end!

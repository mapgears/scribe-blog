Hello everyone, here's my final report for the ScribeUI project.

**Completed this week**

* Released a new version of ScribeUI
* Updated the docs with the new features added this summer
* Announced the release on the mapserver users mailing list
* Updated the demo website with the latest version

**Blocking issues**

No blocking issues this week.

I enjoyed working on this project and learning more about geographic information systems. I hope I can participate again next year!

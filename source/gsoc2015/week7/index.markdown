Hello! This is my seventh report for the ScribeUI project. 

**Completed this week**

* Implemented logging for the map export process
* Started the map import feature. It's almost completed, there's still a few to resolve with the logs and large files.

**Plan for next week**

* Finish the map import feature
* Test map export and import
* Investigate a feature I was asked by a user, to get logs from mapserver instead of shp2img

**Blocking issues**

* No blocking issues this week

Have a nice weekend!

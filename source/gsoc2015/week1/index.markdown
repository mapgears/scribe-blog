Hello! This is my first report for the ScribeUI project. 

1) What do I have completed this week?

* I set up a new blog for the project: http://blog.scribeui.org
* As requested, I made a wiki page for GSoC: https://github.com/mapgears/scribeui/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2015
* I wrote a getting started guide to help new users
* I presented the project on the mapserver users mailing list
* I fixed a few existing bugs

2) What am I going to achieve for next week?

* I want to display Mapserver's errors logs in ScribeUI when there's an error in a mapfile made using the program.
* Fix bugs that come up along the way

3) Is there any blocking issue?

* Setting up the blog with octopress was more complicated than I thought, but now that it's working it's not blocking anymore.

Have a nice week-end!

Hi everyone! Here is my third report for the ScribeUI project.

**Completed this week**

* I had to update CodeMirror to highlight the errors the way I wanted. This update involved fixing a lot of bugs as the previous version was almost 3 years old.
* I fixed a few bugs related to the logs 
* The errors are now highlighted in the result tab. When an error occurs, you can click on it in the logs to go to its location in the result tab.

**Plan for next week**

* The first objective of the summer, improving the error output and debugging is almost complete. I want to add a link in the debug to focus on the correct layer in the Scribe editor section.
* I will review my work so far with my mentors to see if there's anything else I should add to these features
* If everything goes well, I will do a first pre-release and announce it on the mapserver users mailing list.

**Blocking issues**

* I had a few problems while updating CodeMirror but they're all solved now.

Have a nice week-end!

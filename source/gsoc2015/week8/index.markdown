Hi all, here's my eighth report on the ScribeUI project.

**Completed this week**

* Completed map export and import, as well as logging them
* Change the debug logs to use the mapserv command instead of shp2img
* Add a WMS share link next to the maps' description

**Plan for next week**

* One of the ScribeUI users tested the new features this week and sent me a few bugs and enhancements I should work on, I will do that next week
* Release a new version of ScribeUI

**Blocking issues**

* No blocking issues this week

Have a nice weekend!

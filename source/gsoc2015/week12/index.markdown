Hi all, here's my twelfth report for the ScribeUI project.

**Completed this week**

* I added a few controls to the color chooser, to allow changing the order of the colors, or removing all of them.
* There is a new way to classify numeric data: quantile, which makes classes with the same amount of data inside.
* It is now possible to classify datasources imported from a database.

**Plan for next week**

* Get some feedback on the classify function from one of the active users
* Release a new version of ScribeUI
* Update the demo website

**Blocking issues**

No blocking issues this week.

Have a nice week-end!

Hi all, here's my tenth report for the ScribeUI project.

**Completed this week**

* I worked on creating the interface for the classification feature. So far,
this interface contains all the necessary inputs for sequential or qualitative
data.
* I also worked on a color chooser to select individual or ranges of colors
to use for the classes.

**Plan for next week**

* Fetch the appropriate data sources and fields from the mapfile
* Generate and add classes to the mapfile

**Blocking issues**

* No blocking issues this week

Have a nice weekend!

Hello all. Here's my fourth report for the ScribeUI project.

**Completed this week**

* I added error widgets in the editor. Some errors can't be found directly in the editor, only in the result tab, but it gets most of them.
* Added a notification when the map can't render.
* With these changes completed, I released update v1.4. You can see all the details [here](https://github.com/mapgears/scribeui/releases/tag/v1.4).
* Updated the demo and the website for the new release.
* Announced the release on the blog and on the mapserver users mailing list.

**Plan for next week**

* I will start to work on the second task for this summer: import and export. Next week, I want to be able to export maps in a zipped file, and let the user download it. I will have to think about how to pack dependencies like map data, if I do.

**Blocking issues**

No blocking issues this week.

Have a nice week-end!

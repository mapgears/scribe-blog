## Summary of the update

Hello everyone! I am releasing today a third update for ScribeUI, for the 2015 edition of [Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015). This is the final feature update for the summer, which adds a new classifying feature.

## Classify

**Classify** is a new plugin that adds a button to automatically create classes from a set of data. To use it, start by opening a map. On the left side of the screen, you will find a **Classify** button:

Clicking on it will make a new popup appear:

* **Group/Layer** specifies in which group the classes should be added

* **Data source** gives you a list of the data sources in the selected layer. Choose the one you want to use to make classes.

* **Field** is the field to classify. The fields available are those found in the selected data source.

* **Class type** is a choice between **Qualitative**, where all individual values have their own class, and **Quantitative**, where ranges of values have a class.

* **Colors** defines the colors to use for the classes, if any. When clicking on **Choose**, this menu will appear:

To add a single color, choose one by clicking on the black square (if you use Chrome or Firefox), or enter its hexadecimal value. Click on the **Add** button located on the right to add it to the selected colors.

To add a range of colors, choose the starting and last colors, as well as how many colors to generate, then click on **Add**.

To remove a selected color, press on it in the **Selected colors** area and click on **Remove**. To move it, click on **Move left** or **Move right** and to remove all the selected colors, click on **Clear**. When you're done, press on **Confirm** in the bottom right of the popup.

When you're done choosing colors, you will go back to the classify menu. To generate the classes, press on **Confirm** on the bottom right.

Here is an example of the kind of classes you can generate using this feature:

## Summary of the update

I am releasing today the first update for ScribeUI for [Google Summer of Code 2015](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015). I had three main objectives planned for this summer, which you can see in [this previous blog post](http://blog.scribeui.org/blog/2015/05/26/scribeui-on-gsoc-2015/). This update contains the first part of the project, improved error detection. You can try it [here!](http://demo.scribeui.org)


To give you an example, here's what happens when I try to use a comma instead of a dot for a decimal value:

![Example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2997638/8210472/2da645ce-14e0-11e5-87c9-b1cb710e095e.png)

When the map renders pink error tiles, an error message appears over it with a link to open the logs if they're not already open. In the logs, there are two links: one to the location of the error in the result mapfile, and one to the location of the error in the editor. These links are available only when the error returned by mapserver contains the line number.

Sometimes the error can't be located in the editor, often because of the differences between the Scribe syntax and the regular mapfile syntax. When that happens, you should still be able to find it in the result tab.

The **Debug** tab now contains the output of shp2img with debug level 5 using the generated mapfile as the input. The logs generated by shp2img are very useful for debugging. The **Result** tab was also upgraded to a read-only CodeMirror editor, allowing syntax highlighting, error widgets and line numbering.

## Updating

As with the previous release, you can update ScribeUI by using these commands:

    sudo chown -R youruser .
    git pull
    git checkout v1.4
    sudo make perms

You will also need mapserver-bin to use the new debugging feature. If you're updating, use this command:

    sudo apt-get install mapserver-bin

## Plan for the next weeks

The second feature planned is exporting and importing maps and workspaces. This would allow users to share their maps more easily, and it would make it possible to add backups.

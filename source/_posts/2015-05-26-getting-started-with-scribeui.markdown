There is now a Getting Started guide to Scribe UI! It is located on the [project's wiki](https://github.com/mapgears/scribeui/wiki/Getting-started-with-ScribeUI). You can also try ScribeUI without installing it by going on the [demo](http://demo.scribeui.org) page. It is reset every day to keep it from getting too messy.
